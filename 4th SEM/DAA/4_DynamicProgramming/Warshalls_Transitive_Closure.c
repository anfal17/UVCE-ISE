Implements Warshall’s algorithm for computing the transitive closure
Input: The adjacency matrix A of a digraph with n vertices
Output: The transitive closure of the digraph

Algorithm Overview:

Objective: Compute the transitive closure of a directed graph to identify all reachable vertices.
Input: The adjacency matrix A representing direct connections between vertices in the digraph.
Output: The transitive closure matrix, indicating all vertices reachable from each vertex.

Initialization:
- Initialize R(0) with the adjacency matrix A, representing the direct connections between vertices.

Warshall's Algorithm Main Loop:
- For each iteration (k) from 1 to n, update R(k) by considering all pairs of vertices (i, j).
- The transitive closure R(k)[i, j] is updated to true if either R(k−1)[i, j] is true, or there exists a vertex k such that both R(k−1)[i, k] and R(k−1)[k, j] are true.

Explanation:
- The algorithm iteratively considers vertices as potential intermediaries to determine all possible paths between vertices.
- The triple-nested loop structure ensures that every pair of vertices (i, j) is considered for each intermediate vertex k.
- The transitive closure matrix is updated based on the existence of a direct path or a path through an intermediate vertex.
- The final result, R(n), represents the transitive closure of the directed graph.

Return Result:
- The final result is the transitive closure matrix R(n), indicating all reachable vertices in the digraph.
